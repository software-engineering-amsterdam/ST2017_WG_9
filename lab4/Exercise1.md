# Haskell road to logic - Chapter 4: Sets, Types and Lists

Time spent reading: 70m

## Questions

* Why doesnt russels paradox not result in an empty lists?
* Exercise 4.7, If A is a superset and we have another Set B which is defined
as B = {x elem A | x notElem x}. Why is B never inside of A?
Example: A = [[1,2],[5,6]], B = [1,2]
* If non distinct sets are allowed, why can we write {a,b} = {a} iff a = b? (p126)
* The author explains that ordered pairs are possible in Haskell by writing
`(a,b)` but it is certainly possible to write `(2,1)` in Haskell (not an ordered pair) (p139)
