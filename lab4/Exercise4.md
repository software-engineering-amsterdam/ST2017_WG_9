## Reading

We read this chapter on Tuesday and discussed open questions on Wednesday.
Some group members were still had questions regarding "minimal reflexive
transitive closure" and properties of a relation.
Through exercise 7 and mutual explanations we were able to answer all the questions.

All in all this chapter was a good supplementary to the information that was
provided during the lecture.
